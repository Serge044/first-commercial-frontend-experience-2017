## My very first site, which I created and sold for a nominal amount of $1 in 2017.

I created it for a colleague from a past job who in his spare time tried to made money by clicking on links (a very dubious thing from the point of view of income, but still).
Previously he used to send a word file with his referral links, and I suggested to help him to put all these links on the site and put it on the Internet.

Here I have removed all referral links and personal data for privacy purposes, but everything else is as original.
